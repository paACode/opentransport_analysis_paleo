# Introduction

MadeUpCompany AG has recently identified that production employees frequently arrive late to work due to delays in public transportation. This poses a significant challenge since the absence of a single team member can halt the entire production line.

To address this issue, the Production Manager has initiated a research project in collaboration with HSLU.

Three possible countermeasure were identified:

-   Adjust shift start times based on transportation reliability.
-   Implement seasonal adjustments to production capacity based on weather-related transportation disruptions.
-   Consider train categories to mitigate dependency on unreliable train routes.
-   Use weather data and forecasts to predict possible delays

The goal of the Data Science students is to provide MadeUpCompany AG with an insightful report, analyzing publicly available data, to see which of the countermeasures could be most effective.

# Exploring Data

The first step in addressing the research question was to define the project scope and select suitable datasets. The analysis focuses specifically on public transport data for trains arriving in Lucerne, as MadeUpCompany AG is based there. Data from 2024 onward serves as the foundation for more advanced analysis. Additionally, weather data should reflect average Swiss values as a daily baseline.

For this study, data was sourced from [opentransportdata.swiss](https://opentransportdata.swiss/de/ist-daten-archiv/) and the [Schweizer Klimamessnetz](https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/wetter/messsysteme/bodenstationen/schweizer-klimamessnetz.html).

## Tranport Data

[opentransportdata.swiss](https://opentransportdata.swiss/de/ist-daten-archiv/) provides a structured dataset of the public transport in Switzerland.

-   Every month is provided as \*.zip-File
-   Every day is provided as \*.csv-File
-   Every row contains the arrival or departure of a public vehicle

<h3 id = "reduceDataset"> Reduce dataset </h3>



The whole dataset for the year 2024 is roughly \~150GB. Working with such a big data set in R is very time consuming and impractical. Therefore the dataset was reduce to a manageable size before working with R.

The filtering process below reduces the size of the final csv-File to only \~26MB which is way easier to handle than \~150GB.

| Step |                                                            Command                                                             |                       Description                        |

In the end the colnames needed to be added again as they got lost during filtering.

### Data Preparation

The size reduction of the dataset described in Chapter <a href="#reduceDataset">Reduce Dataset</a> enabled the data to be imported into R. After importing the data in R, the preprocessing steps of the shell scripts could easily be validated with a simple unit test.

```{r Import and Validate, echo = TRUE, include=TRUE}
#import libraries
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
#general settings
Sys.setenv(LANG = "en")
#
d.train.raw <-  read.csv(file = "raw_transport_2024.csv", sep = ";")

test_that("Shell Scripts to reduce dataset worked?", {
  expect_equal(unique(d.train.raw$BETREIBER_ABK), "SBB")
  expect_equal(unique(d.train.raw$HALTESTELLEN_NAME), "Luzern")
  expect_equal(unique(d.train.raw$PRODUKT_ID), "Zug")
})
```


Upon reviewing the dataset, we identified several issues that need to be addressed:

- Trains departing late from Lucerne should be excluded, as only the arrival times are relevant to our analysis.
- Arrival times that are predicted rather than measured should also be removed, as we are focusing exclusively on real data.

```{r Clean Up, echo= TRUE, include=TRUE}
# Columns needed: 
# More Information: https://opentransportdata.swiss/de/cookbook/actual-data/
# "BETRIEBSTAG" : categorizing weekday/month/season, merging weather 
# "LINIEN_TEXT" :describing the train category IC, S1 , IR16
# "ANKUNFTSZEIT" : calculation of delay
# "AN_PROGNOSE" : calculation of delay

col.needed <-  c("BETRIEBSTAG",
                 "LINIEN_TEXT",
                 "ANKUNFTSZEIT",
                 "AN_PROGNOSE")

#Filter 
d.train.filtered <-  d.train.raw %>%
  filter(ANKUNFTSZEIT != "") %>% #Remove trains starting from lucerne
  filter(AN_PROGNOSE != "") %>% #Remove trains where delay calc. not possible
  filter(AN_PROGNOSE_STATUS == "REAL") %>%  #Only consider REAL arrival times
  select(all_of(col.needed)) 

```

As next step the dataset was complemented with additional data. For this the delay was calculated and additional categorical variables were created to simplify data analysis.

```{r Complete Dataset }

calc.delay.s <- function(exp.time,
                         exp.time.format,

    expect_equal(length(exp.time), length(actual.time))
    expect_equal(

## Weather Data

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Import weather data from CSV file.
d.weather <- read.csv(file = "raw_weather_2024.csv", sep = ",")
```

The Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss publishes a wide range of data, including the dataset <a href="https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/wetter/messsysteme/bodenstationen/schweizer-klimamessnetz.html">Schweizer Klimamessnetz</a>. This dataset contains the most climatologically significant ground-based measurement stations within MeteoSwiss's measurement network. It consists of 29 climate stations and 46 precipitation stations and includes daily average values of, for example, total snow depth, sunshine duration, precipitation, and air temperature.

### Data Preprocessing

The measurement data from <a href="https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/wetter/messsysteme/bodenstationen/schweizer-klimamessnetz.html">Schweizer Klimamessnetz</a> is available in separate CSV files for each station and day. To maintain manageable complexity for analysis within the scope of this module, all measurement values from the 29 different measurement stations were aggregated, and an average value per measurement unit per day was calculated. This preprocessing was performed using a Python script.

# Step 1: Define file paths
input_folder = "/Users/leonarddost/Documents/RBootcamp/raw_data"
output_file = "/Users/leonarddost/Documents/RBootcamp/swiss_avg_weather_2024.csv"

# Step 2: Load all CSV files with the correct delimiter
file_paths = glob.glob(f"{input_folder}/*.csv")
dfs = [pd.read_csv(file, delimiter=';') for file in file_paths]

# Step 3: Concatenate the data
combined_df = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)

# Debugging: Check the columns in the combined DataFrame
print("Column names in the combined DataFrame:", combined_df.columns)

# Step 4: Replace missing values ("-") with NaN
combined_df.replace("-", np.nan, inplace=True)

# Step 5: Convert numeric columns to numeric types (coerce invalid values to NaN)
columns_to_aggregate = [col for col in combined_df.columns if col not in ['station/location', 'date']]

for col in columns_to_aggregate:
    combined_df[col] = pd.to_numeric(combined_df[col], errors='coerce')

# Debugging: Print rows with NaN values to check for invalid data
invalid_rows = combined_df[combined_df[columns_to_aggregate].isnull().any(axis=1)]

    print("Rows with invalid numeric data detected:")
    print(invalid_rows)

# Step 6: Group by 'date' and calculate averages for numeric columns
avg_df = combined_df.groupby('date')[columns_to_aggregate].mean().reset_index()

# Step 7: Rename the columns
column_mapping = {
    'station/location': 'Wetterstation',
    'date': 'Datum',
    'gre000d0': 'Globalstrahlung',
    'hto000d0': 'Gesamtschneehöhe',
    'nto000d0': 'Gesamtbewölkung',
    'prestad0': 'Luftdruck',
    'rre150d0': 'Niederschlag',

    'tre200dn': 'Lufttemperatur (min)',
    'tre200dx': 'Lufttemperatur (max)',
    'ure200d0': 'Luftfeuchtigkeit'
}

avg_df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)

# Step 8: Export the final DataFrame to CSV
avg_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

print(f"The merged file with updated column names has been saved to: {output_file}")
```

</details>

<p>

In addition to merging and averaging the individual measurement values, the dataset's labels were also renamed for readability. For example, *tre200d0* was renamed to *Lufttemperatur*.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
## Display weather data
library(dplyr)

d.weather %>%
  transmute(
    Datum = Datum,
    Sonnenscheindauer = round(Sonnenscheindauer, 2),
    Niederschlag = round(Niederschlag, 1),
    Temperatur = round(Lufttemperatur, 1)
  ) %>%
  head()

```

Finally, we obtained an average weather dataset for Switzerland for the year 2024, based on the most important ground measurement stations within the MeteoSwiss network.

## Merge train data with weather data

### Prepare dataset for merge

In order to carry out the merge it was observed that the data format of the data set *raw_weather_2024.csv* was different to the format of the *raw_transport_2024.csv*. Therefor the format was manipulated so that both datasets have the same date formate.

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
## Transform date format for further analysis
## Ensure the column is interpreted as a character string
d.weather$Datum <- as.character(d.weather$Datum)

## Format the date correctly
d.weather$Datum <- format(as.Date(d.weather$Datum, format = "%Y%m%d"), "%d.%m.%Y")

## Check the result
head(d.weather$Datum)

```

### Merge the data

Afterwards, to merge the data a left join method was chosen and carried out. The ID used for the merge was the prior prepared date column.

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
## Merge Weather Data into Train Dataset

d.combined <- d.train.compl %>% 
  left_join(d.weather, by = c("BETRIEBSTAG" = "Datum"))

```

# Data Analysis

This analysis chapter examines the temporal and categorical patterns of train delays affecting MadeUpCompany AG employees arriving in Lucerne. By analyzing public transport data from 2024 onward, combined with Swiss weather data, the study investigates delay frequency, duration, and their distribution across weekdays and months. Key metrics, including total and delayed train counts, delay severity, and weather influence, are evaluated to identify trends that could inform effective countermeasures. Through statistical summaries and visualizations, the analysis aims to provide precise, data-driven recommendations to enhance production reliability by mitigating transport-related disruptions.

## Overview of Data

As a first step to get an better understanding of the data set we plotted delays and air temperature. From this first impression plot, we observed that there does not seem to be a clear, strong linear relationship between air temperature ("Lufttemperatur") and the delay. The points are widely scattered and the regression line appears mostly flat. Further, there is a dense clustering of points around zero on the y-axis, indicating that a large number of observations have minimal or no delays, regardless of the air temperature. There are several noticeable outliers where delays exceed 50 minutes, but these events seem sporadic and do not follow a clear pattern with air temperature. The air temperature values primarily fall between 0 and 20 degrees, but within this range, no significant change in delays is visually obvious. However, between 0 and -5 degrees there seems to be a higher delay suggesting further analysis also regarding percipitation. Although the use of jittering is helping to distinguish overlapping points, the overall impression is that delays are not highly influenced by air temperature.

```{r Delay in relation to air temperature, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(d.combined, aes(x = Lufttemperatur, y = delay.calc.min)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "blue", width = 0.2, height = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "orange", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot with Jitter and Regression Line",
       x = "Lufttemperatur",
       y = "Delay (min)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The "Scatter Plot with Jitter and Regression Line" serves as a representative example of the weak relationship observed between weather variables and train delays overall. This suggests that while weather may not be a primary driver of delays, further analysis of potential correlations between delayed trains and specific weather conditions could still reveal hidden patterns. However, before delving into these correlations, it is essential to first conduct a detailed analysis of delay patterns at the weekday and seasonal levels, as seen in the current summary table.

## A Monthly and Weekday Perspective

While weekday patterns highlight operational challenges tied to daily traffic, the broader picture of train delays requires an exploration of monthly trends to capture potential seasonal effects. The "Monthly Overview of Train Delays" reveals further insights into how these factors evolve over time.

The average delay time remains relatively stable between 80 and 110 seconds for most months, but a significant spike in December suggests potential disruptions, possibly due to adverse weather conditions or holiday-related scheduling issues. Interestingly, despite this increase in delay duration, the number of delayed trains in December shows a noticeable decline, indicating fewer train operations during this period. Throughout the rest of the year, the number of delayed trains remains consistently high, with minimal fluctuations from month to month. Furthermore, the percentage of delayed trains remains persistently high at around 60% throughout the year, suggesting that delays are a systemic issue and not solely driven by seasonal factors. This consistent delay rate points to possible underlying operational or structural challenges that require further investigation.

The summary table of train delays by weekday reveals significant differences in train performance across the week. Weekdays generally experience more frequent and longer delays compared to weekends, with **Tuesday** recording the highest number of delayed trains at **8'458** and a high delay percentage of **68.05%**. Similarly, **Thursday** exhibits a high delay percentage of **67.29%** and the longest average delay time of **113.31** seconds, indicating that these days face substantial operational challenges. In contrast, **Saturday** shows the lowest number of delayed trains (**6'572**) and the shortest average delay time (**79.83 seconds**), making it the most efficient day. The weekend, overall, has a lower percentage of delayed trains, with **Saturday (54.36%)** and **Sunday (57.61%)** performing significantly better than most weekdays. This pattern suggests that weekdays, particularly **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, experience higher train traffic and potential congestion, requiring further investigation into scheduling or operational adjustments to reduce delays.
